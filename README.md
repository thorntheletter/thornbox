Custom stickless controller compatible (probably) with most Brooks boards

This is my first time doing PCB design, CAD, and 3D printing so it is probably a bit rough.

## Current Issues:
* The DIP Switch description for tournament lockout is reversed.
* There is not enough room in the top of the case for player LEDs.
* Snackbox Micro buttons end up awkwardly high.
* 3D Printed buttons can be fragile and break easily.
* DP/LS/RS switches do not work. (I believe this to be a problem on the PCB manufacturers end.)
* The screws needing to go from bottom to top through PCB are tricky to get in right.
* I did not have the filament to iterate the tolerances more than once after fixing underextrusion.
* The files to generate pcb graphics footprints are missing (I may also need the hotswap socket / USB-C port footprints)
* The USB-C port is a pain to solder by hand.
