# thornbox
Custom stickless controller compatible (probably) with most Brooks boards

## Current Issues:
* The DIP Switch description for tournament lockout is reversed.
* There is not enough room in the top of the case for player LEDs.
* Snackbox Micro buttons end up awkwardly high.
* 3D Printed buttons can be fragile and break easily.
* DP/LS/RS switches do not work. (I believe this to be a problem on the PCB manufacturers end.)
* The screws needing to go from bottom to top through PCB are tricky to get in right.
* I did not have the filament to iterate the tolerances more than once after fixing underextrusion.
